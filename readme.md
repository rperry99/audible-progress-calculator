# Audible Progress Calculator

I primarily get my book intake from Audible. I also use another website called [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) to keep track of the books I am reading. I like to update the percentages every day when I read / listen to a book.

## The Problem

To get these percentages into Goodreads, I need to manually enter in the percentage. At this time, Audible tells you how long the book is, and how long you have remaining. I have to do the math to figure out the percent of the book I have currently read.

## The Solution

This application will take in the Hours and Minutes of the total length of the book ahd the hours and minutes you have remaining. Based on this, the user will be able to see the percentage that they have listened to.

With this, they will be able to enter in the percentages into Goodreads to keep their stats up to date!
